## Self-Host with Docker

For users who prefer complete control over their data, you can deploy Reactive Resume on your own infrastructure using Docker.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (v20.10 or higher)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2.0 or higher)

<Info>
  There is <strong>no difference in features</strong> between the cloud-hosted version and the self-hosted option. Both provide the same privacy, customization, and functionality. Choose whichever deployment type suits your needs!
</Info>


### Quick Deployment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the Repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AmruthPillai/Reactive-Resume.git
    cd Reactive-Resume
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Environment Variables">
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
    
    ```bash
    # Application
    APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
    
    # Database
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/postgres
    
    # Authentication (generate a secure secret)
    AUTH_SECRET=your-secure-secret-key-here
    
    # Storage (S3-compatible)
    S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=seaweedfs
    S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=seaweedfs
    S3_ENDPOINT=http://seaweedfs:8333
    S3_BUCKET=reactive-resume
    ```
    
    <Warning>
      For production deployments, always use strong, unique values for `AUTH_SECRET` and database credentials.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start the Services">
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
    
    This will start:
    - **PostgreSQL** — Database for storing user data and resumes
    - **SeaweedFS** — S3-compatible storage for file uploads
    - **Gotenberg** — PDF generation service
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access Your Instance">
    Once all services are running, access your Reactive Resume instance at:
    
    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Docker Compose Services

Here's what each service in the stack does:

| Service | Port | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `postgres` | 5432 | PostgreSQL database for storing all application data |
| `seaweedfs` | 8333 | S3-compatible object storage for file uploads |
| `gotenberg` | 4000 | Headless Chrome service for PDF generation |
| `app` | 3000 | The main Reactive Resume application |

### Health Checks

All services include built-in health checks. You can verify everything is running correctly:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

You should see all services with a `healthy` status.

## Environment Variables Reference

Here's a complete list of environment variables you can configure:

### Required Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string | `postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db` |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | Secret key for authentication | Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32` |

### Optional Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `APP_URL` | Public URL of your application | `http://localhost:3000` |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Google OAuth client ID | — |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google OAuth client secret | — |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` | GitHub OAuth client ID | — |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | GitHub OAuth client secret | — |
| `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | S3 access key | — |
| `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | S3 secret key | — |
| `S3_ENDPOINT` | S3-compatible endpoint URL | — |
| `S3_BUCKET` | S3 bucket name | — |
| `S3_REGION` | S3 region | — |
| `FLAG_DISABLE_SIGNUP` | Disable new user registration | `false` |
| `PRINTER_APP_URL` | URL for Gotenberg to reach the app | — |

<Note>
  **Hybrid Setup Note**: The `PRINTER_APP_URL` variable is required when running Reactive Resume outside of Docker while the Gotenberg PDF service is running inside Docker. In this scenario, Gotenberg needs to reach your local app to render resumes for PDF generation. Since Docker containers cannot access `localhost` on your host machine directly, you must set `PRINTER_APP_URL` to `http://host.docker.internal:3000`. This special hostname allows Docker containers to communicate with services running on your host machine.
