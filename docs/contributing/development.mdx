## Setting Up Your Development Environment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the Repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AmruthPillai/Reactive-Resume.git
    cd Reactive-Resume
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
    We use [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as our package manager for its speed and efficiency.
    
    ```bash
    # Install Bun if you haven't already
    curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
    
    # Install project dependencies
    bun install
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start Infrastructure Services">
    Start the required services (PostgreSQL, SeaweedFS, Gotenberg) using Docker Compose:
    
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
    
    <Tip>
      Wait for all services to be healthy before proceeding. Check with `docker compose ps`.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Environment Variables">
    Create a `.env` file in the project root:
    
    ```bash
    # Application
    APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

    # Database
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres

    # Authentication
    AUTH_SECRET=development-secret-change-in-production

    # Storage (SeaweedFS)
    S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=seaweedfs
    S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=seaweedfs
    S3_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8333
    S3_BUCKET=reactive-resume-start
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run Database Migrations">
    Apply the database schema:
    
    ```bash
    bun run db:migrate
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start the Development Server">
    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```
    
    Your local Reactive Resume instance will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
  </Step>

## Understanding the Project Structure

Understanding the project structure will help you navigate the codebase:

```

```

## Working with the Database

### Viewing the Database

Use Drizzle Studio to explore and manage your database:

```bash
bun run db:studio
```

This opens a web-based GUI at [https://local.drizzle.studio](https://local.drizzle.studio).

### Making Schema Changes

1. Edit the schema in `src/integrations/drizzle/schema.ts`
2. Generate a migration:
   ```bash
   bun run db:generate
   ```
3. Apply the migration:
   ```bash
   bun run db:migrate
   ```

<Warning>
  Always review generated migrations before applying them, especially when working with existing data.
</Warning>

## Working with Translations

Reactive Resume uses [Lingui](https://lingui.dev/) for internationalization.

### Adding Translatable Text

Use the `t` macro for strings or `<Trans>` component for JSX:

```tsx
import { t } from "@lingui/core/macro";
import { Trans } from "@lingui/react/macro";

// For plain strings
const message = t`Hello, World!`;

// For JSX content
<Trans>Welcome to Reactive Resume</Trans>
```

### Extracting Translations

After adding new translatable text, extract them to the locale files:

```bash
bun run lingui:extract
```

Translation files are located in the `locales/` directory in `.po` format.

---

## Code Quality

### Linting & Formatting

We use [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting:

```bash
# Check and auto-fix issues
bun run check
```

### Type Checking

Run TypeScript type checking:

```bash
bun run typecheck
```

<Tip>
  Configure your IDE to use Biome for automatic formatting on save. For VS Code, install the [Biome extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome).
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Port 3000 is already in use">
    Another process is using port 3000. Either stop that process or start the dev server on a different port:
    
    ```bash
    PORT=3001 bun run dev
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Database connection refused">
    Ensure Docker containers are running:
    
    ```bash
    docker compose ps
    docker compose up -d
    ```
    
    Check that PostgreSQL is healthy and accessible on port 5432.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="S3/Storage errors">
    Verify SeaweedFS is running and the bucket exists:
    
    ```bash
    docker compose logs seaweedfs
    docker compose logs seaweedfs-create-bucket
    ```
    
    If the bucket wasn't created, restart the bucket creation service:
    
    ```bash
    docker compose restart seaweedfs-create-bucket
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Bun installation issues">
    If you encounter issues with Bun, try reinstalling:
    
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
    ```
    
    Make sure your shell profile is reloaded:
    
    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Type errors after pulling changes">
    The route tree may need regeneration. Run the dev server which auto-generates routes:
    
    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```
    
    Or run type checking to see specific errors:
    
    ```bash
    bun run typecheck
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
