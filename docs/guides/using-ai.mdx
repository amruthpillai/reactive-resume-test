  <Step title="Understand where your data is stored">

  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose a provider">
    In the <Badge>Provider</Badge> field, choose one of the supported providers:

    - **OpenAI**
    - **Google Gemini**
    - **Anthropic Claude**
    - **Ollama** (coming soon)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter a model name">
    In the <Badge>Model</Badge> field, enter the model you want to use (for example, <code>gpt-5.2</code>, <code>claude-4.5-opus</code>, or <code>gemini-3-flash</code>).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Paste your API key">
    In the <Badge>API Key</Badge> field, paste your provider API key.

    <Warning>
      Treat this key like a password. Anyone with it can use your provider account and may incur costs.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify it's enabled">
    After setting the provider, model, and API key, the status indicator at the bottom of the page should show <Badge>Enabled</Badge>.

    <Tip>
      If the status shows <Badge>Disabled</Badge>, double-check that all three fields are filled in.
